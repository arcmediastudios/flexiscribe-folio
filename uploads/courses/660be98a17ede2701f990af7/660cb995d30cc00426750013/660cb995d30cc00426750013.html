<p><strong>Texts &amp; Human Experiences: Extract Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine</strong></p><p><em>I’ve never actually been to a wedding ceremony. I was invited to Loretta’s evening reception a couple of years ago, along with everyone else from the office. It was in a horrible hotel near the airport, and we organised a minibus to get there; I had to contribute to the cost of that, in addition to my bus fare into town and back. </em></p><p><em>Guests were obliged to buy their own drinks all evening, which shocked me. Entertaining is not my area of expertise, I’ll admit that, but surely, if you are a host, you are responsible for ensuring that your guests are provided with a libation? That’s a basic principle of hospitality, in all societies and cultures, and has been since recorded time. In the event, I drank tap water – I rarely imbibe alcohol in public. I only really enjoy it when I’m alone, at home. They did at least serve tea and coffee later in the evening, free of charge; this was accompanied by poor-quality savoury pastries and, bizarrely, slices of Christmas cake. For hours and hours, there was a disco, and terrible people danced in a terrible way to terrible music. I sat on my own and no one asked me to dance, and I was absolutely fine with that.</em></p><p><em>The other guests did seem to have been enjoying themselves, or at least I assume that to have been the case. They were shuffling on the dance floor, red-faced and drunk. Their shoes looked uncomfortable, and they were shouting the words of the songs into each other’s faces. I’ll never go to such an event again. It simply wasn’t worth it, just for a cup of tea and a slice of cake. The evening wasn’t completely wasted, however, because I managed to slip almost a dozen sausage rolls into my shopper, wrapped in serviettes, for later.</em></p><ol><li>What kind of person do we imagine from the first sentence? Based on the first sentence “I’ve never actually been to a wedding ceremony” conveys the idea that she doesn’t go out much and is maybe a little bit anti-social and doesn’t have many friends. She’s shut off from most of the world, and doesn’t have many collective experiences, and most likely enjoys being alone.</li><li>What hints are there that she doesn’t know what happens at a wedding? That she doesn’t have any tastes in dancing.</li><li>The narrator has an awkward emotionless narrative tone – how is this achieved and how does it make her seem? The narrator reinforces the idea she doesn’t drink alcohol in public and enjoys it more at home, which directly conveys this idea she is awkward. Also, the lack of dialogue and exchanges between people as well does this, by showing she doesn’t talk to any people.</li><li>How does Eleanor’s individual experience differ from the collective experience of the same event? The collective experience of people up and dancing, smiling and giggling, is a stark contrast to her pessimistic view of the wedding, where she is unhappy with people’s expression.</li><li>What human qualities and emotions are clear from the extract? Provide evidence from the text. She isn’t actively participating in the wedding, and instead deciding to observe the surroundings as she is unfamiliar, and trys and fails to get a taste of the experience, as she would rather be on her own, and have her own individual experience.</li></ol>
