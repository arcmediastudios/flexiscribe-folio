1.	Definitions

"Approved Source" is Native Documents or a reseller authorized by Native Documents to sell the Software .
"Commitments” means commitments you make in advance to purchase a specific quantity of usage, as measured by Usage Metrics, for 
use during a period of time.  

"Key" means a Phrase Pair or License Certificate, as those terms are defined in clause 3.1.

"Software" means the Native Documents product with which this Agreement was supplied (or available at the point of download), or the 
Native Documents product identified in a Proof of Entitlement, and where applicable includes any software components provided by 
Native Documents which download to and execute in an end-user’s web browser when they access the Software.  Except where the 
context otherwise requires, "Software" includes any Update of that Software that You rightfully receive under this Agreement.

"Proof of Entitlement" is a paid up Native Documents invoice or other Native Documents-issued confirmation of Native Documents' 
grant to You of a License. The Proof of Entitlement must identify You, the Native Documents product, any applicable Usage Metric and 
any Commitments. 

“Usage Metrics” include the following:
•	Documents Exported– the total number of documents saved/exported from the Software in any format (for example, text, docx or 
PDF) during a specified period of time.  If multiple instances of the Software are used, then Documents Exported is the sum of the 
number of documents saved/exported across all such instances during that period.
•	Documents Viewed– the total number of documents opened/viewed in the Software during a specified period of time.  If multiple 
instances of the Software are used, then Documents Viewed is the sum of the number of documents opened/viewed across all such 
instances during that period.
•	Architectural– the number of instances of a specified Software component (eg Native Documents syncd/ndstore component), 
and/or the capacity thereof (expressed for example, as number of sessions).

2.	License Grant.

2.1	Grant. When You purchase or rightfully receive a Key for the Software,  Native Documents grants You a non-exclusive, non-transferrable, 
non-sublicensable license to use the Software during the Term, subject always to any Usage Metric limitations in Your Proof of 
Entitlement (the "License").  You are not granted the right to, and You shall not, exercise the License for an Excluded Purpose.  “Excluded 
Purpose” means making available any product or service (including software-as-a-service, platform-as-a-service, infrastructure-as-a-
service) that competes with the Software or Native Documents services based on the Software.

2.2	Copying and Installation. You may copy and install the Software on any device under your control that supports it, subject always to any 
Usage Metric limitations in Your Proof of Entitlement.

3.	Unlocking

3.1	Procedure. In order to be able to use the Software effectively, you must sign-up with Native Documents and obtain either a license 
"Phrase Pair" (in the form of an ID and secret) or "License Certificate", then make it accessible to the Software and configure the Software 
to read it.

3.2	Licensing Server. A Phrase Pair is verified from time to time against a licensing server operated by Native Documents ("Licensing Server").  
Accordingly, in order to use the Software effectively with a Phrase Pair, the Software will need a network connection to the Licensing 
Server, which you acknowledge and accept.  In contrast, a License Certificate enables use of the Software without an Internet connection, 
during the period in which the License Certificate is valid.

3.3	Key must be kept Confidential. You will ensure that You keep your Key confidential. You shall notify Native Documents promptly of 
any unauthorized use of any Key or any other known or suspected breach of security or misuse of  the Software. You are 
responsible for use of the Software by any and all employees and other users that access the Software through Keys provided to 
You.  From time to time we may provide you with an updated Key.  You agree to promptly install this most recent Key, and delete 
all earlier Keys.   You acknowledge that Key generally only allow access to or use of the Software for a certain period of time, and 
that when that time expires, your access to the Software may cease, or become limited in some way, without further notice to You.  At 
Native Documents’ option, we may permit continued use after your Key expires, such use to be billed/charged on a consumption basis.   
You must not distribute your Key to a customer or other third party.  Contact Native Documents if you wish to obtain a key on behalf of a 
customer or prospect.

4.	Free Tier Use

If You use the Software free of charge and with a Phrase Pair, then the terms of this clause 4 shall apply (“Free Tier Use”).

The right to use is for the period enabled by the Phrase Pair and Licensing Server, however Native Documents has the right to 
immediately revoke and terminate Your right to use the Software for Free Tier Use at any time without notice. 

You acknowledge that the functionality of the Software might be limited in certain respects ("Usage Limitations"), and Native 
Documents shall have the right to downgrade, limit or otherwise modify the Software made available at any time without notice.

You agree not to use multiple Phrase Pairs or to swap between Phrase Pairs with the intent to circumvent any Usage Limitations. You 
agree that any use of the Software beyond the Usage Limitations requires a paid Commitment.

You may choose at any time to terminate this Agreement by revoking your Key in our developer portal.  You must immediately stop using 
the Software and promptly destroy all Keys in Your possession or control, as provided for in clause 16.3.

5.	Proof of Concept and Evaluation Use

5.1	If You use the Software pursuant to a proof of concept or evaluation License Certificate (“Evaluation Use”), then the terms of this 
clause 5 shall apply. Evaluation Use shall include use of any beta or non-production Software. Native Documents may allow 
Evaluation Use for a fee or at no charge to You, as mutually agreed between Native Documents and You. The right to use is for the 
period enabled by the License Certificate or as specified in writing in an order document, whichever is the lesser. 

5.2	You may use the Software solely for the internal purpose of evaluating and testing the Software for suitability with the Your 
application and You shall not make available the Software or access thereto to any third party other than in accordance with this 
Agreement. Native Documents shall have the right to downgrade, limit or otherwise modify the Software made available for 
Evaluation Use at any time without notice, and the right to immediately revoke and terminate Your right to use the Software at any 
time. 

5.3	You represent and warrant that: (a) You have not previously evaluated the relevant Software, and (b) You will not attempt to, by 
any means, evaluate the Software again without payment. You agree that violation of this provision or this Agreement may subject 
You to monetary penalties, including payment of all applicable fees as if the Software were in production use.

6.	Term

6.1	Initial Term. The initial term of this Agreement begins on the date Native Documents provides a Key (or access to a Key) to You 
(“Commencement Date”) and extends for the period specified in the Proof of Entitlement (or if the Software  is provided for 
Evaluation or Free Tier Use, for the period specified in clause 4 or 5.1 respectively hereof) (unless earlier terminated, the “Term”). 

6.2	Automatic Renewal. Unless a party notifies the other of its intent not to renew prior to the end of the then current Term (or as provided 
in clause 13), the Term will automatically extend for a further 12 months. We may require you to agree to a new agreement, a 
supplemental agreement or an amendment before processing a renewal. Prices for fee-based subscriptions may change in the future.

test the Software and any Updates thoroughly before deploying it in a production environment; and (d) ensure the adequacy, integrity, 
security, virus checking and accuracy of your data and computer systems and operate all necessary back-up procedures to ensure your 
data is safe in the event of any outage, damage or other event or issue.

8.2	You may choose to or we may invite you to submit comments or ideas about improvements to the Software, our API, or any other

unsolicited by us, and delivered to us without any restrictions on our use of the Idea. You also agree that Native Documents has no 
fiduciary or any other obligation to you in connection with any Idea you submit to us, and that we are free to use your Ideas without any 
attribution or compensation to you.

9.	Ownership. Native Documents and Native Documents’ licensors, respectively, retain exclusive ownership of all right, title, and interest of

version of the Software under the then existing Agreement.   Any use by You of Updates made available by Native Documents 
longer than seven (7) days after Native Documents’ notification of any such Modifications shall constitute your acceptance of 
this Agreement as Modified. 
To the extent that it is held that applying a Modification to this Agreement is invalid or would render this an illusory or unenforceable 
contract, such change shall be limited to the extent necessary to be valid or to avoid this Agreement being deemed illusory or 
unenforceable as the case requires.
Native Documents shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to change, delete, discontinue or impose conditions on any services ("Service 
Change") it provides to You, including, but not limited to technical support options and other product-related policies, by communicating

UBUNTU FONT LICENCE Version 1.0
-------------------------------

PREAMBLE
This licence allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely. The fonts, including any derivative works, can be
bundled, embedded, and redistributed provided the terms of this licence
are met. The fonts and derivatives, however, cannot be released under
any other licence. The requirement for fonts to remain under this
licence does not require any document created using the fonts or their
derivatives to be published under this licence, as long as the primary
purpose of the document is not to be a vehicle for the distribution of
the fonts.

DEFINITIONS
"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
Holder(s) under this licence and clearly marked as such. This may
include source files, build scripts and documentation.

"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components
as received under this licence.

"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the
Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to
a new environment.

"Copyright Holder(s)" refers to all individuals and companies who have a
copyright ownership of the Font Software.

"Substantially Changed" refers to Modified Versions which can be easily
identified as dissimilar to the Font Software by users of the Font
Software comparing the Original Version with the Modified Version.

To "Propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification and with or without charging
a redistribution fee), making available to the public, and in some
countries other activities as well.

PERMISSION & CONDITIONS
This licence does not grant any rights under trademark law and all such
rights are reserved.

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a
copy of the Font Software, to propagate the Font Software, subject to
the below conditions:

1) Each copy of the Font Software must contain the above copyright
notice and this licence. These can be included either as stand-alone
text files, human-readable headers or in the appropriate machine-
readable metadata fields within text or binary files as long as those
fields can be easily viewed by the user.

2) The font name complies with the following:
(a) The Original Version must retain its name, unmodified.
(b) Modified Versions which are Substantially Changed must be renamed to
avoid use of the name of the Original Version or similar names entirely.
(c) Modified Versions which are not Substantially Changed must be
renamed to both (i) retain the name of the Original Version and (ii) add
additional naming elements to distinguish the Modified Version from the
Original Version. The name of such Modified Versions must be the name of
the Original Version, with "derivative X" where X represents the name of
the new work, appended to that name.

3) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) and any contributor to the
Font Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any
Modified Version, except (i) as required by this licence, (ii) to
acknowledge the contribution(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or (iii) with
their explicit written permission.

4) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole, must
be distributed entirely under this licence, and must not be distributed
under any other licence. The requirement for fonts to remain under this
licence does not affect any document created using the Font Software,
except any version of the Font Software extracted from a document
created using the Font Software may only be distributed under this
licence.

TERMINATION
This licence becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are
not met.

DISCLAIMER
THE FONT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF
COPYRIGHT, PATENT, TRADEMARK, OR OTHER RIGHT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE
COPYRIGHT HOLDER BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING
FROM, OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE FONT SOFTWARE OR FROM OTHER
DEALINGS IN THE FONT SOFTWARE.
